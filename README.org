#+title: Render Editor.js blocks in Qwik

Render your Editor.js blocks in Qwik apps.

This is *Work in Progress* for now, I'm focusing mainly on things I need in my
projects. *PRs welcomed.*

* Roadmap
** TODO Suport for all blocks [4/10]
- [ ] Code
- [ ] Delimiter
- [ ] Embed
- [X] Header
- [X] Image
- [X] List
- [X] Paragraph
- [ ] Quote
- [ ] Raw
- [ ] Table

** TODO Lighter input sanitization
For now, I'm using [[https://github.com/kkomelin/isomorphic-dompurify][isomorphic-dompurify]], but whole thing seems little too heavy
for my needs.

Sanitization of input is definitely needed and couple most of libs I found
either don't work client side, don't work isomorphic or aren't safe at all.

Editor.js is currently depending on non-maintained sanitization library. And it
might be better/safer idea to run different one anyway.

This library is rewrite of [[https://github.com/moveyourdigital/editorjs-blocks-react-renderer][editorjs-blocks-react-renderer]] for Qwik, kudos to [[https://github.com/moveyourdigital][Move Your Digital]].
